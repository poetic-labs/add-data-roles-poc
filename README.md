This script recursively looks over a directory, grabs HTML files and parses
them, adding data from a mapfile to the output.

Before use, set up a github repo with your site's mapFile (see Jones for
example).

Add a .env to the root with the path to your webflow directory and a path to
your mapFile export then run the script.

##This script currently overwrites the webflow directory.
